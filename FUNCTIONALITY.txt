FUNCTIONALITY.txt, which should discuss the interface that your system implements. What operations does it export? What is the effect of each operation? Diagram or give high-level psuedocode for the cryptographic protocol being used within each operation or within collection of operations.

Be sure to pay careful attention to the following (and, as appropriate, discuss them in FUNCTIONALITY.txt).

Methods by which keys are chosen or generated and are erased.
How and where keys are stored.
Use of correct and efficient cryptographic idioms for confidentiality and for integrity. (E.g., Are you using ECB? Should you be?)
Padding and other issues associated with message length.
Sizes of keys and nonces.
Unnwarranted dependence on assumptions about operating system functionality.
