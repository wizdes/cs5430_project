1) Overview
This is demonstrate the functionality of our project, SecurEdit. SecurEdit is a secure, colloborative, peer to peer based text editor. In this document, we will go other the machine authentication, human authentication, and human authorization functionalities.

a) Confidentality

All communication between machines are subject to Dolov-Yao attacks. Because of this, we encrypt our messages either with AES session keys or message information in methods such that important information is not revealed (see RPC protocol). Furthermore, our program all encrypted file securely using AES encryption, encrypting all confidential information with an AES cipher that is generated using a key generator on a user generated password. 

b) Integrity

We guarantee the integrity of both the data sent between machines as well as data stored on disk by calculating an HMAC of the unencrypted data before encrypting the the concatenation of the HMAC and the unencrypted data. As mentioned in the online lecture notes "[2/10] Applied Cryptography Notes" under the section (Part 3: Confidentiality and Integrity), the process of 'MAC then Encrypt' is considered safe and guarantees integrity.

c) Availability

We use TCP to address issues of availability that involves dropped or out of order packets. 

2) Functionality

a) Machine Authentication

i) Session key exchange protocol

This is done using the SRP protocol to exchange a session key. See section iii for more information.

ii) Message protocol

The message follows the following protocol. Once both machines have received a session key, they use this to encrypt and send messages between each other.  We plan on using this to implement the following message sending protocol:
A and B are machines.
A is trying to send a message m to B.
K_AB is the shared key of A and B.
HMAC is the hmac of the encrypted object.
c_i is a counter which keeps track of the number of messages which have been seen from user i(this solves our 3 message nonce protocol used previously).

1) A -> B : {A, B}K_AB, HMAC, c_i
2) If c_i > previous_c_i then
	//process application messages
   else
	//Ignore message

iii) SRP

b) Human Authentication

In human authentication, one user wishes to join the chat session being hosted by another user (the owner).  In order to do so, they initiate by sending a clear text message indicating their desire to join.  The owner responds with a message encrypted with a one time PIN, which the owner is responsible for transferring to the user securely outside of our application (e.g. by telling them in person, or writing on a piece of paper.). Once the user has the PIN, they can input it in order to decrypt the message from the owner. This is used to initialize the RPC protocol.

i) SRP

The SRP protocol is used to authenticate a human into a machine.

ii) Password mechanism  

One important element of the RPC protocol is the selection of a password. To ensure the security of the password, some restrictions are placed. These restrictions are: 
- it must be a alphanumeric password
- it must have both upper and lower case letters
- it must be at least 12 characters long
  
c) Application layer

i) Hosting a document

To host a document, a user simply presses the 'Create Document' button in the main view. This creates a document that allows peers to connect. This is done by having a listening thread that responds to UDP broadcasts for finding LAN documents as well as TCP requests to join the document.

ii) Joining a document

To join a document, a user starts by finding a document to join on (either via manually adding the information or using the UDP broadcast). Next, if user either logs into the document or creates an account to the document if he/she has not done so before. If the user has not logged in before, then the user needs to create an account. This requires a one time PIN exchange to give the document owner the necessary authenication information. Next, the user logs in with his username and his password to gain access to the document.

iii) MAC

The document implements a MAC authorization protocol. Each user has a level, as well as each character in the document. The system is designed such that the document owner is allowed to determine levels for each other. Furthermore, this system implements a 'read-down', 'no read-up', and allows writes only at the same level. Each user is allowed to request to change to a new level.

iv) Configuration

d) Encryption

ii) AES

We used the standard Java SecureRandom random number generator to create an initialization vector using the 'SHA1PRNG' algorithm and using the 'AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding' algorithm to generate a symmetric AES key with 128 bytes.

iii) HMACs
We used the standard Java MAC class to generate an HMAC of our messages using the 'HmacSHA256' algorithm.

e) Network
The Network layer provides the functionality to send and receive encrypted messages; the actual application interfaces only with a "send" function, to which it passes objects of type application.Message.  These will be subclassed in subsequent phases to send application specific data. The network layer utilizes the SecureTransport package to encrypt messages using either RSA (for initial exchange of the shared session key), or AES (for exchanging messages with the session key).
