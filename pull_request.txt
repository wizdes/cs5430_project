So.. pull requests summarized.

When you are coding, always work on a separate branch.

# assuming you are starting on the master branch
git checkout -b branch_name
# will take you to a new branch

# Then you write lots of sweet code.
# Then commit as normal.
git add -A
git commit -m "super sweet feature"

# Push your new branch up to GitHub
# NEVER push to the master branch directly; this will circumvent our code review process
git push origin branch_name

Once your branch is on GitHub
