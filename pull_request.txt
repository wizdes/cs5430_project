So.. pull requests summarized.

When you are coding, always work on a separate branch.

# assuming you are starting on the master branch
git checkout -b branch_name
# will take you to a new branch

# Then you write lots of sweet code.
# Then commit as normal.
git add -A
git commit -m "super sweet feature"

# Push your new branch up to GitHub
# NEVER push to the master branch directly; this will circumvent our code review process
git push origin branch_name

Once your branch is on GitHub, you can go to the home page for our repo, then click the "branches" tab, then click the "compare" button next to your branch.

Or you can just use this url
https://github.com/wizdes/cs5430_project/compare/master...sample_branch

and replace "sample_branch" with your branch name.

This page contains a summary of the changes (by commit, and by file) between this branch and master. "Pull Request" is a button located at the top of this page, and it triggers an email to the other team members (I think, you should check your settings to make sure you get them).  Once the pull request has been issued, anyone of us CAN merge it (so Github wil not enforce the semantics we discussed of code reviewing; there's nothing to stop you from merging your own pull request). 

If the reviewer has comments, they can leave them inline.  If it looks good, then you can merge in the changes from the GitHub GUI.
