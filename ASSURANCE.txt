1) Overview 

We used a combination of standard Java implementations of security measures as well as unit tests on every package of our system to increase assurance in the correctness of our system.

2) Unit Test Cases

We introduced unit tests for each package of our cryptographic substrate. 

3) Other Assurance Mechanics

There are several other assurance measures that were taken to increase the assurance in the correctness of the system.

a) SealedObject
We used the Java class 'SealedObject' to encapsulates a Java object and encrypts it.
b) SecureRandom
We used the Java class 'SecureRandom' to general random numbers securely.
c) RSA Encryption/Decryption
	We are using the standard Java class KeyPairGenerator with the 'RSA' algorithm. This is initialized with the highest level of SecureRandom (from the Javadocs). It encrypts/decrypts with the 'RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding' algorithm.
	i) size of Keys
	We are using a 3584 bit RSA keys which support our large authentication messages.
d) AES Encryption/Decryption
e) Nonces
	We are using nonces to ensure the system is not susceptible to replay attacks. The specific protocols in using nonces during machine authentication is detailed in FUNCTIONALITY.txt.
f) HMACs
	We are using HMACs to ensure the integrity of the data we are sending. The HMAC is generated using the standard Java implementation of HMACs.
g) Code Reviews
	We used Github's 'Pull Request' feature to code review all commits going into the master branch. This allows us to confirm all changes with the entire team and reduce the number of errors pushed into code.

h) Class Design 
	To reduce programmer error and prevent any leakage of insecure data, we abstracted our system into three layers. The bottom layer is the networking transport layer which provides basic networking functionality of a multi-client socket architecture. it is within this layer that serialization of messages occurs. The second layer is the security layer which packages messages into
