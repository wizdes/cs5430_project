1) Overview 

For this project, we combined several standard Java implementations of security measures with unit tests and careful code maintenance. 

2) Unit Test Cases

We introduced unit tests for the new functionality introduced into the system.

3) Integration Tests

Although created numerous unit test cases to increase our assurance of the system, we also introduced several Integration Tests to analyze our system from an end-to-end perspective.  

3) Other Assurance Mechanics

There are several other assurance measures that were taken to increase the assurance in the correctness of the system.
